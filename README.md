# QuPulses
A framework for working with quantum pulses in a cascaded manner, using the virtual cavity approach and the SLH formalism

In the Example.py file is a small example of using the functionalities of the package is shown. The 
example aims to show how to use the input-output theory presented in the series of papers [1-4]
and can be run on its own without the need of the rest of the QuPulses functionality, although the
example contain copies of many of the functions found in this package.
